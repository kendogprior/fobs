A website dedicated to the sailors of O.R.P Blyskawica.
 Blyskawica was a Polish warship which bravely defended the harbour towns of Cowes and East Cowes on the Isle of Wight from German air attack on the nights of 4/5 May 1942.

 The Blyskawica was built in East Cowes between the wars and had sailed to Cowes for repairs and re-fitting in 1942.
